# Receipt Generator

This project is about a random recipe generator that uses API from themealdb.com.
it is a simple front-end project with three pages

## Make this work
I used these libraries:
- @material-ui, 
- react, 
- react-router-dom 
- @material-ui/icons
- @material-ui/lab


Make sure to add in node modules if you want to make this work by yourself!
